		</h3>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c2 c1">
				We only collect information about you if we
				have a reason to do so&ndash;for example, to provide our Services, to
				communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect
				information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us,
				automatically through operating our Services, and from outside
				sources. Let&rsquo;s go over the information that we collect.
			</span>
		</p>
		<h4 class="c0" id="h.uadz4j5zkry5">
			<span class="c14 c1">Information You Provide to Us</span>
		</h4>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c2 c1">
				It&rsquo;s probably no surprise that we
				collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of
				information depends on the context and how we use the information.
				Here are some examples:
			</span>
		</p>
		<ul class="c12 lst-kix_d7dfvg690zw2-0 start">
			<li class="c7">
				<span class="c2 c1">
					Basic Account
					Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set
					up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for
					a numici.com account to provide their first and last names and email
					address. The email address is used as their user id to login to our
					services. You may provide us with more information, like your phone
					number and Organization, but we don&rsquo;t always require that
					information to create a numici.com account. For creating enterprise
					accounts, you must provide the Organization name.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c6">
				<span class="c1">
					Profile Information: If
					you have an account with us, we collect the information that you
					provide for your profile. For example, if you have a numici.com
					account, your username is part of that profile, along with any other
					information you put into your profile, such as a photo or an
					&ldquo;About Me&rdquo; description. Your profile information is
					visible to other users in the organization. Users in other
					organizations can only if they have your email address through other sources.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c6">
				<span class="c1">
					Transaction and Billing
					Information: If you buy something from us&ndash;a subscription to a
					numici.com plan, for example&ndash;you will provide additional
					personal and payment information that is
					required to process the transaction and your payment,
					such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c6">
				<span class="c2 c1">
					Content Information:
					You have complete control of the content you collect and create. It
					is visible only to those users with whom you either explicitly share
					the content or store the content in a container that has been shared
					with them. Vidi Vici Technologies staff, including our admins, do
					not have any access to your content through the numici application.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c6">
				<span class="c2 c1">
					Credentials: our
					application needs the credentials to connect to the various
					repositories where we store your content, like documents,
					annotations, conversations etc. These credentials are stored in an
					encrypted form and keys are available to a very small number of Vidi
					Vici Technologies senior staff. &nbsp;There are times when we
					request you to give us temporary access to your data to enable us to
					troubleshoot and fix problems. 
				</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c6">
				<span class="c2 c1">
					Communications With Us
					(Hi There!): You may also provide us information when you respond to
					surveys, or communicate with our Engineers about a support question.
				</span></li>

			<span class="c14 c1">Information We Collect Automatically</span>
		</h4>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c2 c1">We also collect some information
				automatically:</span>
		</p>
		<ul class="c12 lst-kix_sc4hllx6qhh4-0 start">
			<li class="c7"><span class="c2 c1">Log Information: Like
					most online service providers, we collect information that web
					browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such
					as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language
					preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating
					system, and mobile network information. We collect log information
					when you use our Services.</span></li>
			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Usage Information: We
					collect information about your usage of our Services. For example,
					we collect information about the type of actions, but not the
					content, you take using numici products and services. We use this
					information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as
					get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our
					Services better.</span></li>
			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Location Information:
					We may determine the approximate location of your device from your
					IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example,
					calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic
					regions. We may also collect information about your precise location
					via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with
					location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile
					device operating system&rsquo;s permissions.</span></li>
			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Stored Information: We
					may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile
					app. We access this stored information through your device operating
					system&rsquo;s permissions. For example, if you give us permission
					to access the photographs on your mobile device&rsquo;s camera roll,
					our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you
					upload a photo of a presentation you are attending to your
					repository.</span></li>
			<li class="c6"><span class="c1">Information from Cookies
					&amp; Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a
					website stores on a visitor&rsquo;s computer, and that the
					visitor&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the
					visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small
					blocks of code placed on websites and emails. At this time, numici
					services do not use store or use any cookies on your devices. &nbsp;</span><span

			<span class="c14 c1">Information We Collect from Other Sources</span>
		</h4>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c2 c1">We may also get information about you from
				other sources. For example, if you create or log into your numici.com
				account through another service (like Google or Slack), we will
				receive information from that service (such as your username and
				basic profile information like email address) via the authorization
				procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends
				on which services you authorize and any options that are available.
				We may also get information, such as a mailing address, from third
				party services about individuals who are not yet our users
				(&hellip;but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for
				marketing and advertising purposes like postcards and other mailers
				advertising our services.</span>

			<span class="c2 c1">We do not sell our users&rsquo; private

		</p>
		<ul class="c12 lst-kix_3pesgfwor0vb-0 start">
			<li class="c7"><span class="c2 c1">Subsidiaries,
					Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information
					about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who
					are our independent contractors that need to know the information in
					order to help us provide our Services or to process the information
					on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and
					independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal

			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Third Party Vendors: We
					may share information about you with third party vendors who need to
					know information about you in order to provide their services to us,
					or to provide their services to you or your site. This group
					includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like
					payment providers that process your credit and debit card
					information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze
					fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services
					that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support
					services that help us communicate with you, those that assist us
					with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying
					a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing
					campaigns), and those that help us understand and enhance our
					Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to
					privacy commitments in order to share information with them. </span></li>
			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Legal Requests: We may
					disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court

			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Business Transfers: In
					connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition
					of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the
					unlikely event that Vidi Vici Technologies goes out of business or
					enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the
					assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of
					these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to
					apply to your information and the party receiving your information
					may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this
					Privacy Policy.</span></li>
			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">With Your Consent: We
					may share and disclose information with your consent or at your

			<li class="c6"><span class="c2 c1">Aggregated or

			<span class="c14 c1">Information Shared Publicly</span>
		</h4>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c2 c1">Information that you choose to make public
				is&ndash;you guessed it&ndash;disclosed publicly, for example public
				links you create to your content which in turn becomes visible to
				anyone with access to that public link. Public information may also
				be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep

			<span class="c5">How Long We Keep Information</span>
		</h3>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c1">We generally discard information about you
				when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we
				collect and use it--which are described in the section above on How
				and Why We Use Information--and we are not legally required to
				continue to keep it. For example, we keep the logs that record
				information about use of numici services, such as the visitor&rsquo;s
				IP address, browser type, and operating system, for </span><span class="c1">approximately
				30 days</span><span class="c2 c1">. We retain the logs for this
				period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to
				Vidi Vici Technologies&#39; services and investigate issues if
				something goes wrong on one of our services. We retain aggregated
				data from the logs without any user specific information to enable us
				to do long term analysis of system usage. As another example, when
				you delete a document, web resource, or an annotation or comment, it
				stays in your Trash folder for thirty days just in case you change
				your mind and would like restore that content--because starting again
				from scratch is no fun, at all. After the thirty days are up, the
				deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</span>

			<span class="c5">Security</span>
		</h3>
		<p class="c10">
			<span class="c2 c1">While no online service is 100% secure, we
				work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized
				access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures
				to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential
				vulnerabilities and attacks. </span>
